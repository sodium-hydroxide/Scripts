# Scripts
 These are a collection of scripts I have written for a variety of purposes. Several are implementations of built in functions for the purpose of better understanding the methodology. Explanations of each project will be found in the header along with a brief history of changes. Below will be a brief explanation of each project.


### `-Testing.ipynb`

This is a temporary `jupyter` notebook used for writing many of the `python` and `julia` scripts. This will typically remain empty unless I am actively working on a project.

### `EXPONENT.bas` and `MANTISSA.bas`

These are a pair of functions which I import in `Excel` to obtain the exponent and mantissa of a number given some base.

### `linearRegression.jl` and `linearRegression.py`

These are implementations of linear regression models in `python` and `julia`. They include calculations of uncertainty in the slope and intercept for error propagation purposes.

### `packageLoad.R` and `scriptSource.R`

This pair of functions will check if `R` packages are installed and load them into a script as well as source several functions which may be used.

### `projectile.m`, `projectile_force.m`, and `projectile_motion.m`, `projectileMotion.jl`

These are `MATLAB` functions which use Euler's method to solve for the trajectory of a particle subject to both linear and quadratic drag forces. This function was also rewritten in `julia`.

### `ROUNDSIGFIG.bas`

This is a function which may be imported into `Excel` to round a number to the correct number of significant digits.

### `RungaKutta.R` and  `rungaKutta4.jl`

These are implementations of Runga-Kutta 4 algorithms in `R` and `julia`.

### `topasParse.jl`

This is a function which will parse the outputs from the Tool for Particle Simulation to a more readable format.
